# Real Estate Agent CRM - [Demo](https://realestatelistingapp.herokuapp.com/)

## Why I chose to make a realestate agent crm? 

When I started this project, I had done a couple of online courses about coding. I had no previous knowledge of coding, so there was a steep learning curve. After 3-4 months of doing these courses, I realised if I wanted to learn coding, I had to build a project of my own. 

That is what this is really. My first real project. 


## What after?
**I called hundreds of brokers after launching this demo** to see if they would be interested in buying this site. I literally went to 99Acres and MagicBricks, and picked agents by the city. 
Finally a few were interested but then because this was also my first code project, it wasn't a big enough value addition for them. All in, it was a great exposure and learning experience for me.
